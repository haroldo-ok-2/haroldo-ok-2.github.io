 <h1>Haroldo's experimental webapps</h1>
 
 <p>This page hosts various programming experiments I performed over the years on my free time.</p>
 <p>Please, do take a look at them below:</p>
 
 <h2>Web applications</h2>

 <ul>
   <li><a href="https://haroldo-ok-2.github.io/bitsy-converter/">Bitsy Converter</a>, a application to convert Bitsy scripts into various formats (just JSON, for now; others may come soon).</li>
   <li><a href="https://haroldo-ok-2.github.io/tyrian-railshooter/">Tyrian Railshooter</a>, a 2.5 D railshooter mixing Tyrian-based graphics mixed with gameplay inspired by Tyrian itself, Space Harrier, Galaxy Force and Axelay (currently, it's just a tech demo; more to come later).</li>
   <li><a href="http://rge.haroldo-ok.com/">Retro game editor</a>, a, currently unfinished, editor that allows one to edit a game visually and then convert it into a playable SEGA Master System ROM.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.haroldo-ok.com/RgbQuant-SMS.js/RgbQuant-SMS.js/demo/index.html">RgbQuant-SMS</a>, a fully functional tool that allows one to automatically reduce the tile count of an image so as to fit the tile count limitations of the Sega Master System. Also, by adjusting the color count, it can be used for other tile-based hardware.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.haroldo-ok.com/blockly-z80/blockly-z80/demos/commands/index.html">Blockly-Z80</a>, a tool to generate Z80 code from a Blockly-based visual language.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/twine-monogatari">Twine-Monogatari</a>, a Twine 2 story format that allows one to use Twine 2 to create Visual Novels for the Monogatari engine.</li>
 </ul>
