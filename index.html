 <h1>Haroldo's experimental webapps</h1>
 
 <p>This page hosts various programming experiments I performed over the years on my free time.</p>
 <p>Please, do take a look at them below:</p>
 
 <h2>Web applications</h2>

 <ul>
   <li><a href="https://haroldo-ok-2.github.io/bitsy-converter/">Bitsy Converter</a>, a application to convert Bitsy scripts into various formats (just JSON, for now; others may come soon).</li>
   <li><a href="https://haroldo-ok-2.github.io/tyrian-railshooter/">Tyrian Railshooter</a>, a 2.5 D railshooter mixing Tyrian-based graphics mixed with gameplay inspired by Tyrian itself, Space Harrier, Galaxy Force and Axelay (currently, it's just a tech demo; more to come later).</li>
   <li><a href="http://rge.haroldo-ok.com/">Retro game editor</a>, a, currently unfinished, editor that allows one to edit a game visually and then convert it into a playable SEGA Master System ROM.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.haroldo-ok.com/RgbQuant-SMS.js/RgbQuant-SMS.js/demo/index.html">RgbQuant-SMS</a>, a fully functional tool that allows one to automatically reduce the tile count of an image so as to fit the tile count limitations of the Sega Master System. Also, by adjusting the color count, it can be used for other tile-based hardware.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.haroldo-ok.com/blockly-z80/blockly-z80/demos/commands/index.html">Blockly-Z80</a>, a tool to generate Z80 code from a Blockly-based visual language.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/twine-monogatari">Twine-Monogatari</a>, a Twine 2 story format that allows one to use Twine 2 to create Visual Novels for the Monogatari engine.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Programming tools</h2>
 
 <ul>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/sam-simple-adventure-maker-sms/">SAM - Simple Adventure Maker</a>, This is a tool for creating simple adventure games for the Sega Master System. Pretty barebones, pretty much unfinished, but it should be enough for making some simple games.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/twee2sam">twee2sam</a>, a tool that is intended to convert Twee projects (that you can export from Twine) into SAM projects. With it, it's possible to create Sega Master System adventure games using Twine..</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/BlocklyVN32X">Blockly VN32X</a>, a tool that allows anyone to make a visual novel for the Sega 32X using Blockly.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/sms-gbdk-compat">sms-gbdk-compat</a>, a compatibility layer that allow games made with GBDK to be ported to devkitSMS (work in progress).</li>  
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/genesis-rpg-creator/">Genesis RPG Creator</a>, an editor that, would it have been finished, would allow anyone to make their own RPG for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive; unfortunately, I eventually lost interest on the project. The current version is limited to a single map.</li>  
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Retro games</h2>
 
 <ul>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/duckslayer-adventures">Duckslayer Adventures</a>, a tribute to an Atari 2600 game named 'Adventure'. In it, you control the intrepid Knight of the Square Table, Sir Jelly, the gelatinous cube. His mission is to retrieve the Holy Chalice of Yendor that's stored inside the black castle, guarded by two fearsome Duck Dragons, and bring it back to the yellow castle.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/the-question-vn32x">"The Question" for VN32X</a>,a sample project for BlocklyVN32X; it's based on Ren'py's example of the same name.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/sms-datingsim">sms-datingsim</a>, a very simple dating sim for the Sega Master System, made with twee2sam.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/sms-rogue">sms-rogue</a>, a very simple, unfinished, roguelike for the Sega Master System.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/datastorm">Data Storm</a>, a Sega Master System clone of an Atari 2600 game named Turmoil.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/haroldo-ok/twin-maze">Twin Maze</a>, my secondary entry for SMS Power's 2016 competition. I originally intended to make a simultaneous two player first person maze game, with competitive modes (deathmatch and race) and cooperative modes (vs monsters). Due to time constraints, though, it is, for now, more of an unoptimized tech demo where two players can explore a maze simultaneously. There's currently no other objectives other than that.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/ultima-3-sms/">Ultima 3 for Sega Master System</a>, this was a try at making a version of Ultima 3 for the Sega Master System.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/star-control-combat-engine-gameboy-color/">Star Control combat for GB</a>, this was an attempt to implement Star Control’s combat system on the gameboy.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/soko-master-sms/">Soko Master</a>, This was a Sega Master System game I programmed for the 2007 SMS Power Coding Competition. It’s a fully implemented Sokoban clone with skinning support and hundreds of levels.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/river-strike-sms/">River Strike</a>, an unfinished attempt at making a River Raid clone for the Sega Master System.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/pong-master-4k-sms/">Pong Master</a>, a Sega Master System game I programmed for the 2006 Minigame Compo. It’s basically a Pong clone, but I also tried to add the possibility of putting ‘spin’ to the ball, with very weird results.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/joust-sms/">Pong Master</a>, a try at making a version of Joust for the Sega Master System. The graphics are partially done, the flying and scenery collision physics are implemented, but not much else.</li>
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/headless-ninja-volley-sms/">Headless Ninja Volley</a>, a Sega Master System game I programmed for some PDRoms coding competition (I don’t remember which). In that competition, you had to create a game that used only four colors.</li>  
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/dungeon-3d-sms/">3D Dungeon for Sega Master System</a>, a try at making a first person dungeon game for the Sega Master System.</li>

   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/ultimate-tetris-sega-genesis/">Ultimate Tetris for Sega Genesis</a>, a tetris clone for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</li>  
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/stormer/">Stormer</a>, a clone, for MS-DOS, of an old Atari 2600 game named Turmoil.</li>  
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/keystone-kapers-gameboy-color/">Keystone Kapers for Gameboy Color</a>, a clone of Actvision’s Keystone Kapers for the Gameboy Color.</li>  
   <li><a href="http://haroldo-ok.github.io/gameboy-color-raycasting-system/">Gameboy Raycasting System</a>, an experiment to make a raycasting engine for the Gameboy Color. Originally, I had intended to make a first person shooter out of this, but the resulting low resolution and still lower frame rate made me think otherwise.</li>
